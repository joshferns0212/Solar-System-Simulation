# Solar System Simulation
2017/2019 Computer Science CPT to create a "realistic" simulation of the solar system. The speeds and size of each object was set to reflect their speed and size relative to the other objects. For the size, they were set to only reflect the order of sizes. For example, Jupiter was the largest and Mercury was the smallest. The actual numerical value assigned was somewhat arbitrary as it would be impossible to represent their true proportions on a small screen. However, their orbtial distance and speed was calculated to relfect the actual proportions as well as I could. There is also an option to show the orbtits or not.
